Define climate science: "Climate" by definition are the prevailing weather conditions in a geographic area over a long period of time.
explain issues in climate science
climate implies long period of time to establish patterns in weather, we're limited by how long we've collected data
for weather it's been around ~100 years, for the ocean it's been significantly less (since about the 1970s)
we have many physical equations that explain weather --> these drive our weather forecasts
for climate models, we can either: 1) run extended weather model predictions --> not extremely accurate (as anyone who's looked more than a few days ahead for weather predictions has seen) 2) analyze statistical relationships between weather and climate using historical records and physics
