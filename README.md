# Machine Learning in Climate Change 

Welcome to Machine Learning in Climate Change! The goals of this lesson are introduce you to the basics of ScikitLearn, Keras, and Tensorflow on High Processing Computers within the Python. We're approaching this lesson in two parts: 
  - Part 1: Simple Time Series Prediction Using Long-Short-Term-Memory Techniques, and 
  - Part 2: Using Time Series Prediction on Geospatial Data 

## Part 1 
Part 1 will focus on using a singular time-series of sea surface temperatures (SST) from NOAA buoy data, found here (insert link here). After this, you'll be provided quick scripts to prepare the data for processing, and begin creating your machine learning script. The Python skills and packages can be found here:
- Pandas Libary (scrubbing the data)
- Scikit Learn and Keras (for the machine learning) 
- Matplotlib (to plot your timeseries) 

## Part 2
Part 2 will expand on the initial time series into a whole set of geospatial information. Instead of using buoy data, we'll be training our model using """"""" model output data. We'll be able to evetually compare the singular-point SST data to the model output, as well as predict entire geographic reigons. The python skills we'll build upon are: 
- netcdf4 (to process the geospatial images) 
- Scikit Learn and Keras 
- Matplotlib
