Welcome to the Machine Learning Approaches in Climate Science Workshop! This workshop is aimed at doing several things, including explaining what climate science is, and the obstacles that come to modeling climate, as well as introducing some basic-yet-powerful machine learning methods that can aid in accelerating our understanding of climate science. 


> ## Prerequisites
>
> * Have a Google Colab Account 
> * Basic understanding of Python 
>
{: .prereq}

By the end of this workshop, students will:

* Have a basic understanding of Machine Learning
* Have a basic understanding of climate science, and how machine learning can play a role in accelerating our understanding of cliamte science
* Have the outline for assessing problems in climate data
* Have a step-by-step guide for a basic LSTM Model and it's application to climate data
